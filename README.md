The Portals Onboarding training consists of different learning paths for native and web developers. 

**Note:** Need to bundle the Capacitor plugin tutorial in here, somewhere.

## Native Developers
In this training, native developers will take a scaffolded iOS/Android app and leverage Portals to transform it into a superapp.

### Outline
1. Using Portals
	1. Installing Portals and Bundling Web Assets
	2. Registering & Defining the Superapp's Portals
	3. Creating a Dynamic Portal View
2. Communication Mechanisms
	1. Passing Initial Context
		1. User ID
		2. Access Token
	2. Using `PortalPlugin` to Dismiss Portals
	3. Building a Capacitor Plugin
		1. Token Refresh
	4. Using an existing Capacitor plugin 

## Web Developers
In this training, web developers will take a web app and leverage the Portals API to communicate with a native Portal.

### Outline
1. Implementing a Capacitor Plugin
2. Publishing Messages using `PortalMessage`
3. Stubbing Initial Context for Development

## Architects + Leads
Architects, leads, and other senior technical members do not require platform training. Instead, brainstorming sessions should be scheduled to plan the following:

1. What information should be shared between the web and native parts of a Portal?
2. What native functionality do web apps need access to?
3. How will web and native communicate?
4. Who will define and enforce API contracts for Portal communication?
