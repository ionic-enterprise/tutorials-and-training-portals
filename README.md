## 10/27/23 Notes

Almost ready to start writing the web training and scaffold the iOS/Android apps.

Before doing so, figure out the following:

1. [ ] `useSyncExternalStore` for user session.
2. [ ] Expose user data in components.
1. [ ] Where will initial context go in the most framework agnostic manner?
2. [ ] Where will the call to refresh the user session on MFE load go in the most framework agnostic manner?
3. [ ] What is the most framework agnostic manner to pass the User ID (post refresh call) into the get expenses loader?

And rip out anything that the reader should be doing as part of training.
